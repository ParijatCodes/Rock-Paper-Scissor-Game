# 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors — C Edition

A simple, fast, and fun implementation of the classic **Rock Paper Scissors** game, written in C for the command line.

Challenge the computer in a game of logic and luck!

## 📌 Overview

This program allows a user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The computer randomly selects its move, and the user is prompted to input theirs. The game then compares the two and declares a winner.

---

## 🧪 Example Gameplay

```bash
Choose 0 for Scissors, 1 for Paper and 2 for Rock 
> 1
Computer chose 2
You win!
```

## 🛠️ How to Run

### 🔧 Requirements

- GCC compiler or any C-compatible compiler
- Terminal / Command Line interface

### ⚙️ Compilation & Execution

gcc main.c -o RockPaperScissorGames
./RockPaperScissorGames
